sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because the run time in the random file and reversed is very long while the run time
in the sorted file is very short which makes me believe omega(n) for best case and O(n^2) for worst case.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Run time is very short in all scenarios compared to the other 2 algorithms.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Run time is long across the board even in the best case scenario (sorted 50000) pointing to n^2 in all cases.
