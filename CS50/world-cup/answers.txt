Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of simulations predictions were all over the place, I saw Switzerland
winning, Spain too but mostly Brazil. 

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

I would say a good enough number of simulations to run is 100000, Belgium and Brazil
are too close to be certain of the results with 10000 or less simulations.

But it also depends of what am i looking for, if i just want to know the top 2 teams
running 1000 simulations is good enough.
