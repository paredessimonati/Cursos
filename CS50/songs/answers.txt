If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

SELECT ((AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) + AVG(danceability))/3) FROM songs;
0.619987666666666

According to that, a little Pink maybe?


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Maybe have an AI go through all the lyrics and classify them by mood, message, novelty, and other parameters.
Add them to the metadata and try to consider all that information, with more data points we could have a more accurate result.
