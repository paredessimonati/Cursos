The following two questions will both ask you about the optimization problem
described below.
A farmer is trying to plant two crops, Crop 1 and Crop 2, and wants to maximize
his profits. The farmer will make $500 in profit from each acre of Crop 1
planted, and will make $400 in profit from each acre of Crop 2 planted. 

However, the farmer needs to do all of his planting today, during the 12
hours between 7am and 7pm. Planting an acre of Crop 1 takes 3 hours, and
planting an acre of Crop 2 takes 2 hours.

The farmer is also limited in terms of supplies: he has enough supplies
to plant 10 acres of Crop 1 and enough supplies to plant 4 acres of Crop 2.

Assume the variable C1 represents the number of acres of Crop 1 to plant,
and the variable C2 represents the number of acres of Crop 2 to plant.
